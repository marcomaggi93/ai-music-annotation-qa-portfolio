## 2. Harmonic Function Analysis
Global Tonal Center

A minor is clearly the governing key.

Modal ambiguity arises from the natural F and G in the bass (Aeolian collection).

No raised leading tone; modality remains pure Aeolian rather than tonal minor.

Section-by-Section Harmonic Breakdown
📍 Intro (0.00–10.69)

Harmony: tonic focus (A minor) with a pedal A implied.

Piano repeats the same melodic/rhythmic cell (A-minor tetrachord: E–A–B–C) eight times.

Function: establishes key; extremely stable.

QA difficulty: low energy contrast → may be merged with Section A by auto-models.

📍 Section A (10.69–32.03)

Bass outline: A → C → F → G (Aeolian-mode progression).

Piano repeats the initial ostinato without alteration.

Entry of muted strings and warm pads, both strictly using A Aeolian pitches.

Function: prolongation of tonic with modal color shifts.

Stability: harmonic loop stable; textural enrichment mild.

QA difficulty: boundaries rely on timbre, not harmony — often problematic.

📍 Section A1 (32.03–53.36)

Harmonic ground: identical to Section A (A–C–F–G loop).

Variation arises from:

small ornamental piano tones within Aeolian scale (e.g., upper E or A),

slightly more present strings,

subtle registral and textural additions.

No functional modulation; purely textural variation.

QA difficulty: high risk of over-segmentation due to micro-variations in density.

📍 Section B — Climax (53.36–89.99)

Harmony remains A Aeolian; no new chords introduced.

Primary differentiator:

Piano increases rhythmic activity (transitioning from steady eighth-note figurations toward denser, faster subdivisions → accelerated surface rhythm).

Strings and pads achieve their maximum thickness.

Overall spectrum widens; stronger sense of motion.

Function: textural and kinetic climax, not harmonic.

QA difficulty: models may detect this boundary correctly because of energy jump, even though harmony is unchanged.

## 3. Critical Points for Automatic Boundary Detection
Issue Type	Where It Occurs	Why It Happens
Under-segmentation	Intro → A	Low timbral contrast; identical harmony
Over-segmentation	A → A1	Micro-variations misinterpreted as new sections
False emphasis on energy	A1 → B	Models may rely on loudness rather than harmonic cues
Missed outro	End of B	Fade is gradual; not a true formal “Outro”

## 4. Professional Evaluation Summary

The piece is an ideal test case for texture-based structural detection, since harmony stays constant while density evolves.

Nearly all boundaries are timbral/registral, not harmonic → difficult for automatic segmentation.

Harmonic language is strictly A Aeolian, contributing to the ambiguity of mid-level boundaries.

Section labels chosen (Intro → A → A1 → B) are musically justified and coherent.

Track: Stay in the Blue Light
Model: Suno v5 (Custom Mode — Manual Lyrics)

No timecodes provided by the user for this track. Structure matches the generated form:
Intro → Verse 1 → Pre-Chorus 1 → Chorus 1 → Verse 2 → Pre-Chorus 2 → Chorus 2 → Bridge → Final Chorus → Outro.

Section Label	Description Summary
Soft Intro	E♭m7 → C♭M7 → G♭M → D♭M; vocal ad-libs; highly stable, atmospheric.
Intro (Vocal)	Same harmonic loop; vocal enters; still low density, smooth build into Verse 1.
Verse 1	Loop: E♭m7 → C♭M7 → G♭M → D♭M ×2; core R&B verse harmony; stable and cyclical.
Pre-Chorus 1	E♭m → C♭M → G♭M → B♭m; gentle lift in harmonic tension; prepares hook.
Chorus 1	Bass-only progression: E♭ → C♭ → G♭ → D♭ ×2; reduction of upper harmony; vocal-forward hook.
Verse 2	Same bass-only loop as Chorus; minimal harmonic activity; maintains groove continuity.
Pre-Chorus 2	E♭m7 → C♭M7 → G♭M7 (with natural F) → D♭M; slight color variation via G♭M7; mild intensification.
Chorus 2	Bass-only loop again: E♭ → C♭ → G♭ → D♭ ×2; same hook environment, consistent energy.
Bridge	E♭m → C♭M → G♭M → D♭M → then arpeggiated C♭M → E♭m → G♭M → D♭M; texture drops, harmonic clarity increases.
Final Chorus	Same bass loop: E♭ → C♭ → G♭ → D♭ ×2; return of main melodic hook.
Outro	E♭m → C♭M → G♭M → D♭M; smoother ending; final D♭M closure.
2. Harmonic Function Analysis
Global Tonal Center

The track is firmly set in E♭ minor.

Modal material is diatonic to E♭ Aeolian (E♭–F–G♭–A♭–B♭–C♭–D♭).

No raised leading tone → modal, not tonal minor.

Major-quality chords (C♭M, G♭M, D♭M) clarify the Aeolian environment.

Section-by-Section Harmonic Breakdown

📍 Soft Intro

Harmony: E♭m7 → C♭M7 → G♭M → D♭M.

Function: establishes modal center; extremely stable.

QA note: intro subdivides into two micro-zones, but harmony is identical.

📍 Intro (Vocal)

Identical progression; voice enters without altering harmony.

Function: formal introduction to lyrical content.

📍 Verse 1

Loop repeated twice: E♭m7 → C♭M7 → G♭M → D♭M.

Very stable; classic future-R&B verse pattern.

QA difficulty: boundaries rely more on vocal phrasing than harmony.

📍 Pre-Chorus 1

New loop: E♭m → C♭M → G♭M → B♭m.

Introduction of B♭ minor increases pre-dominant tension.

Function: clear lift into the hook.

📍 Chorus 1

Reduction to bass-only loop: E♭ → C♭ → G♭ → D♭ ×2.

Harmonic implication remains the same, but upper chords are omitted.

Function: open space for hook vocals; typical R&B minimal chorus.

📍 Verse 2

Same bass-only loop; maintains groove continuity.

Harmonic stability high; variation mostly timbral.

📍 Pre-Chorus 2

Loop: E♭m7 → C♭M7 → G♭M7 (with natural F) → D♭M.

Slightly more color due to G♭M7; mild intensification.

Function: re-establish lift into the second hook.

📍 Chorus 2

Same as Chorus 1; consistent vocal-forward texture.

📍 Bridge

First pass: E♭m → C♭M → G♭M → D♭M.

Then: arpeggiated C♭M → E♭m → G♭M → D♭M.

Function: contrast section through texture reduction, not harmonic contrast.

QA difficulty: easy to mis-label as a soft “verse-like” section.

📍 Final Chorus

Bass-only loop again.

Restores the main hook.

📍 Outro

Full chord loop returns: E♭m → C♭M → G♭M → D♭M.

Function: smooth resolution; clear closing cadence.

3. Critical Points for Automatic Boundary Detection
Issue Type	Where It Occurs	Why It Happens
Verse Confusion	Verse 1 → Pre-Chorus 1	The lift is subtle; models may not detect pre-dominant harmonic function.
Chorus Ambiguity	Chorus ↔ Verse 2	Both use bass-only loop; difference is almost entirely timbral/vocal-phrasing.
Bridge Mis-labeling	Pre-Chorus 2 → Bridge	Harmony similar; contrast is textural, not harmonic.
Outro Mis-segmentation	Final Chorus → Outro	Outro is short; first lines resemble Chorus melody and may be merged.

4. Professional Evaluation Summary

The track is an excellent test case for vocal-centric R&B structural detection.

Harmony is highly stable → boundaries depend on texture, vocal phrasing, and drum density.

Repeated E♭m → C♭M → G♭M → D♭M framework strongly enforces modal Aeolian center.

Choruses remove upper harmony, creating hook clarity via harmonic reduction.

Bridge stands out mostly by texture and register, not harmonic novelty.

Outro may be misinterpreted by models because its first phrases mirror the final chorus.
