## PROMPT 2 "Stay in the blue light" (v1, Suno 5) 

Title

Stay in the Blue Light

Instruction

Generate a future R&B / alternative pop song cue with female intimate vocals, following the provided lyrics. Focus on a vocal-forward arrangement, soft rhythmic groove, and modern minimal production. Maintain clarity, warmth, and emotional restraint.

Structure

Target narrative flow matching typical R&B modern form and consistent with the lyrics:

Intro → Verse → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Verse → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Bridge → Final Chorus → Outro

(SUNO correctly generated: intro → verse → pre-chorus → chorus → verse → pre-chorus → chorus → bridge → chorus → outro.)

Instrumentation

Warm Rhodes electric piano, clean sine-sub bass, airy sustained pads, soft synth plucks for accents, light trap-lite drum kit (kick, snare, subtle hi-hats).
No harsh percussive transients, no rock drum elements, no EDM risers.

Dynamic curve

Energy curve 3 → 6 / 10

soft intro → steady verse → subtle pre-chorus lift → restrained but expressive chorus

maintain low-to-medium density

keep vocals close-miked and forward in the mix

Mood palette

Intimate, moody, futuristic, sensual, emotionally controlled, nighttime aesthetic.

Target duration

Approx. 2:40 – 3:00 (Suno generated 3:34 autonomously — acceptable, as Suno does not obey duration constraints reliably).
