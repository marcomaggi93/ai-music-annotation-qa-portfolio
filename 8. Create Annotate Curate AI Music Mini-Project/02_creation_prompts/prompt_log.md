# Prompt Log ELEVENLABS MUSIC — Track A (Glass Echoes in Motion)

## Prompt (ENG)
Modern neo-classical minimalist underscore, contemplative and hypnotic. Felt piano ostinato, muted strings, warm pads. Around 90 BPM in A minor, instrumental only. Structure flows from sparse intro to evolving pulse and soft release. Constraints: no heavy percussion or dramatic hits. Duration ~1:40.

## Generated Versions
- Version 1 (selected)
- Version 2

## Chosen Version & Reason
Selected: **Version 1**.  
Version 2 does not respect the BPM (60 instead of 90), the piano motif is fairly monotonous and not very original, while Version 1 features a more interesting and engaging piano figurations.  
In addition, Version 2 contains some strange, not clearly identifiable sounds and lacks muted strings entirely.

## Quick Notes (Possible Improvements)
In a future iteration, increase the presence of muted strings to create a more balanced dialogue with the piano.

## Generated Versions
- **Version 1**
- **Version 2**

## Selected Version & Reason
**Selected: V1.**  
V1 and V2 are similar in structure, but V1 has a more intimate, sensual, and delicate vocal delivery. The instrumentation is more minimal and better balanced, staying closer to the intended “modern intimate future R&B” aesthetic.  
In V2, the synth plucks and warm Rhodes become more intrusive, appearing more frequently and disrupting the intended intimate atmosphere.  
V1 maintains strong coherence across Verse, Pre-Chorus, and Chorus sections, with consistent harmonic and melodic identity.

## Quick Notes
- V1: more intimate and sensual vocal tone; cleaner arrangement.  
- V2: Rhodes and synth plucks too present, reducing subtlety and mood.   
- Atmosphere in V1 stays focused on bass, minimal drums, subtle plucks, and voice.
- The model (in the selected V1) partially misinterprets the Outro: the first lines of the written Outro are rendered using the same melodic and structural profile as the Final Chorus, delaying the actual Outro until the final two lines.
- The outro is rendered somewhat abruptly, lacking a smooth fade-out

## Possible Improvements (Chosen Version)
- Make the Bridge more engaging (slightly richer percussion or alternative chords).  
- Add small melodic gestures or micro-variations in the Rhodes or synths.  
- Introduce subtle rhythmic variation to avoid excessive uniformity.
- The model (in the selected V1) partially misinterprets the Outro: the first lines of the written Outro are rendered using the same melodic and structural profile as the Final Chorus, delaying the actual Outro until the final two lines. A clearer structural separation or slight reharmonization could help the model avoid merging the Final Chorus and Outro into a single extended chorus block.
- The outro is rendered somewhat abruptly, lacking a smooth fade-out and ending instead with a truncated final phrase. A more gradual release or atmospheric decay would improve structural closure and emotional continuity.
- Airy pads requested in the prompt are not clearly audible; a low-register pad or synth layer provides harmonic support.
