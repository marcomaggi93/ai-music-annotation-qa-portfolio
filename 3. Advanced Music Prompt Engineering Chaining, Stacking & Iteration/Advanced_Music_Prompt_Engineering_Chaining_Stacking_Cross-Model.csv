**Structure**:  
- Verse 1  
- Verse 2  
- Chorus  
- Bridge  
- Final Chorus  

***Mood***: Introspective, bittersweet, tense yet emotionally fragile.  

****Style****: Poetic and metaphorical, using vivid imagery and psychological depth.  
Use flowing lines, soft enjambments, and internal rhymes.  
The chorus must be emotionally strong and melodic.  
Avoid clichés – aim for authentic emotion.

Shadow in the doorway, silent as the dawn
Glass across the carpet, all the color gone
Memories in fractures, falling through the seams
Tried to hold the moment, vanished in between

Verse 2
Rooms become a mirror, echoing my name
Empty in the sunlight, nothing feels the same
Breathing in the absence, softer than the night
Tracing distant answers just beyond the light

Chorus
Now I am the silence,
Every truth undone
Bittersweet horizon,
Nowhere left to run
Heart, a slow reflection
Wounded but alive
Grieving in the quiet
Learning to survive

Bridge
Silver veins unravel,
Threads of who I was
Underneath the surface,
Letting go because
Change is like a fever—
Never asks for more
Standing in the stillness,
Different than before

Final Chorus
Now I am the silence,
Broken, yet complete
Haunted by the kindness
That I couldn’t keep
Bittersweet horizon,
Lost but I remain
Grieving in the quiet
Turning into rain";"You are a professional music composer and arranger.

Project Goal: Underwater documentary soundtrack with introspective and fluid mood – developed from a poetic cinematic narration (GPT) and shaped through multi-step audio iteration";"Role:
You are a poetic screenwriter writing short cinematic texts to guide soundtrack composers.

Context:
The scene takes place underwater, in an art film or nature documentary. The visual atmosphere is immersive, slow, and introspective. There are no sudden movements — only light, silence, and drifting marine life. The emotion is quiet, melancholic, and meditative, evoking both beauty and solitude.

Task:
Write a short, poetic 3-line cinematic narration (not lyrics). Each line should be brief, evocative, and symbolic.
Avoid rhymes, clichés, or direct references to ""water"" or ""ocean."" Instead, use metaphors that suggest fluidity, time, memory, or depth. The tone should be elegant, refined, and emotionally restrained.
