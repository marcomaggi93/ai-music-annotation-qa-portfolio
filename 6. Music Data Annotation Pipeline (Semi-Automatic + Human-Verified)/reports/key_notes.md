- P01 Model A SUNO 4.5.mp3 → D minor (manual = auto). Coherent with powerful, heroic trailer mood.
- P02 Model B ElevenLabs.mp3 → C major (manual = auto). Clear tonal center; aligns with calm, reflective ambience.
- P03 Model A Suno 4.5.mp3 → F# major (manual = auto). Bright major tonality enhances emotional intensity of pop ballad.
- Prompt 3 v2 SUNO 4.5.mp3 → D major (manual = auto). Serene and majestic, consistent with cinematic ambient tone.
- Prompt 3 v3 SUNO 4.5.mp3 → D major (manual = auto). Stable, reverent atmosphere confirms correct detection.
- Prompt 5 v2 (finale) SUNO 4.5.mp3 → Intro in Gb major; sections B–C shift to Eb minor (relative modulation). Auto key (Eb minor) valid for second half.

Notes: All automatic key detections are musically coherent. Minor discrepancies reflect intentional modal or relative key shifts typical of cinematic/ambient works.
