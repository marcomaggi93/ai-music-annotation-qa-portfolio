# BPM Notes (Week 6)

- P01 Model A SUNO 4.5.mp3 → double-time detection (manual 100 vs auto 198.8)
- P02 Model B ElevenLabs.mp3 → double-time detection (50 vs 99.4)
- P03 Model A Suno 4.5.mp3 → double-time + final rallentando (69 vs 136.0)
- Prompt 3 v2 SUNO 4.5.mp3 → no clear beat at start (ethereal texture), steady piano pulse appears later; no percussion → unstable BPM detection (79 vs 126.0)
- Prompt 3 v3 SUNO 4.5.mp3 → correct detection (84 vs 84.7)
- Prompt 5 v2 (finale) SUNO 4.5.mp3 → only piano figuration gives rhythmic reference; overall ethereal texture with no percussion → rubato phrasing + final rallentando (40 vs 120.2)

Notes: slow, rubato, or percussion-free passages often cause double-time or unstable BPM readings in automatic detection.
