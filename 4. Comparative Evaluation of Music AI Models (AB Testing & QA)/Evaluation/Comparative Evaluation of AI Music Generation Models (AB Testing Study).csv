P01;"A short epic/cinematic style orchestral piece (around one minute expected) with brass and strings, for an action movie trailer. No vocals. Powerful orchestral percussion (timpani, taiko, bass drum),deep cinematic low drones. 


FIXED PARAMETERS: duration, instrumentation, genre and style, no vocals, tempo at 100 BPM";Suno 4.5;A 45 seconds cinematic orchestral instrumental piece, at 100 BPM for an action movie trailer. Centered on bold brass fanfares and sweeping string sections, the arrangement conveys grandeur and action. Massive orchestral percussion—timpani, taiko, and deep bass drums—provides powerful rhythmic drive, punctuating dramatic transitions. Dark cinematic low drones underpin the score, adding weight and tension to the foundation. Strings deliver pulsing ostinatos that interlock with soaring brass stabs, creating momentum and a sense of rising conflict. Wide stereo depth and cavernous reverb amplify the immersive atmosphere, while layered orchestration evolves toward a climactic finale. The structure begins with ominous drones, builds through intensifying rhythmic interplay, and culminates in a bold, percussive surge. No vocals are present. The mood is powerful, heroic, and cinematic, ideal for trailer use.;https://suno.com/s/ri1y3YkdCfxRJyqs;4;3;5;4;4;2;4;4;4;3;N/A;37;The track matches the brief and conveys the intended mood. The driving rhythm from the percussion and the string ostinato work well, and the BPM is correct. However, melody and especially harmony are too simple, relying mostly on two alternating chords. The ending feels cut short, as the climax lacks the necessary impact. Brass timbre sounds slightly artificial in a couple of passages. The duration does not perfectly match the requested length, although the target of a short piece around one minute was broadly achieved.
P02;"~60 seconds of a calm ambient soundtrack for a guided breathing meditation app. Gentle piano chords and sustained strings, evolving slowly with soft reverb and airy pads. No vocals, tempo around 60–70 BPM. Mood: serene, grounding, reflective. 

FIXED PARAMETERS: duration, genre and style, no vocals, instrumentation, tempo";Suno 4.5;A 60 seconds calm ambient instrumental track for guided breathing meditation. Short intro with soft felt piano chords and natural reverb. Sustained warm strings and airy pads gradually join, expanding the texture without climax. Tempo 60–70 BPM, no percussion. Long reverb and wide stereo depth create immersive spaciousness. Mood: calm, serene, meditative.;https://suno.com/s/YHuWNzUJk4qpTnZx;3;3;3;3;3;2;4;4;2;3;N/A;30;"The piece presents a cohesive structure but limited internal variety, with an abrupt ending. Harmony is simple yet logical, with a clear, repetitive piano theme and slight variation at the close. Tempo is stable but slower (~40 BPM) than the 60–70 BPM indicated in the prompt; the absence of percussion suits the style. The piano sound is well produced with reverb and stereo depth, while strings and pads blend into a single subdued timbre that remains in the background. Atmosphere is coherent and intentionally without climax, though the continuous piano sextuplets add excessive motion for a meditative track. The mix is clean and spacious, with no glitches, but strings/pads remain too recessed. Usability fits meditative contexts, though again the piano motion reduces suitability as background. Harmony could allow looping, yet the ending is not designed for cyclic playback."

Core instruments (piano + strings + gentle percussion)";Suno 4.5;A heartfelt pop ballad at 72 BPM with expressive female vocals, intimate yet powerful. Nostalgic, longing, and soul-stirring, inspired by Christina Aguilera’s ‘Hurt’. Piano chords lead the arrangement, joined by warm strings, acoustic guitar, lush synth pads, and soft backing harmonies. Gentle electronic percussion and subtle bass support the voice without overpowering it. The song evolves from a tender verse to a soaring chorus, reaching an emotional climax in the bridge before fading into a reflective, cinematic outro. ;https://suno.com/s/bdxSDjy0wE6HWBjP;4;4;5;4;3;3;3;5;4;4;4;43;"Tempo slightly slow (~69 BPM). Outro feels abrupt; smoother fade or instrumental close would work better. Strong, expressive and well-pitched vocal of high quality, clearly responsive to the prompt. Chorus powerful; verses and pre-choruses solid. Harmony coherent but overuse of unresolved V4 weakens impact; bridge adds variation but climax is stronger in the chorus. Outro progression (VI46–IV) feels less conclusive. Warm strings and pads too low; bass dominant. Vocals upfront, occasionally overpowering; high vibratos somewhat harsh/redundant. Overall clean mix, good melodic/harmonic variation, stylistically consistent throughout."

Orchestration cohesive with high-quality sound; strings, percussion, and drones blend well, but brass elements are missing. Narrative arc follows the intended structure but feels underdeveloped due to the brief climax and abrupt ending.

Harmony based on four repeated chords, functional for meditation; melody repeats with a final variation, effective but not highly original. Stable rhythm and pulse, though tempo is closer to ~50 BPM instead of 65. Good sound quality: felt piano with natural reverb, strings and airy pads fit well; an added guitar, while stylistically fitting, was not requested. Atmosphere calm and reflective as intended, but the slight crescendo of strings/pads and the guitar add excess motion. Clean audio and balanced mix, though piano is too dominant in the intro. Flow is smooth overall, but the abrupt ending reduces seamlessness and loopability."

Core instruments (piano + strings + gentle percussion)";ElevenLabs Music;Heartfelt pop ballad at 72 BPM with expressive female vocals, nostalgic and longing. Piano-led with warm strings, acoustic guitar, lush pads, subtle bass, and subtle percussion. Soulful, emotional ballad style. Verse ? chorus ? bridge climax ? reflective outro. Chorus harmony and vocal line must remain the same across repetitions. With provided lyrics. (Duration set to 4:00);https://elevenlabs.io/music/songs/sBeq9UCdQiJXmVYJz8xb;3;2;4;2;1;2;4;3;3;1;2;27;"The piece is cohesive but monotonous, with sections too similar, static tension, no clear climax, and an abrupt ending. The vocal melody changes constantly with no recognizable chorus; harmony is simple and mostly correct (sevenths, slight bridge variation, final modulation to IV) but inconsistent, with unusual progressions such as III–IV in the outro. Rhythm and timing are steady, BPM respected, and vocal groove natural. Piano is clear and balanced, voice upfront, bass supportive; guitar is too subdued, lush pads faint, and subtle percussion and warm strings missing. Mood is nostalgic as intended, yet dynamics stay flat, choruses lack build, and the outro feels unresolved. Audio is clean and well balanced, though pads and guitar sit too low. Accessibility is weakened by unclear section references: verses/choruses not distinct, bridge anonymous, outro underdeveloped. The track fits the mood but needs clearer, more expressive sections. Vocals show good intonation and tone, but expression is flat, bridge lacks impact, and some lines are rushed with overlapping syllables, reducing lyric clarity; phrasing and prosody need refinement."
