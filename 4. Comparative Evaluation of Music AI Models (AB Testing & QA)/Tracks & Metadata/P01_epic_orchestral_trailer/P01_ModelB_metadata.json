  "brief": "A short epic/cinematic style orchestral piece (around one minute expected) with brass and strings, for an action movie trailer. No vocals. Powerful orchestral percussion (timpani, taiko, bass drum), deep cinematic low drones.",
  "prompt_text": "Cinematic orchestral trailer at strict 100 BPM, instrumental only, for an action movie trailer. Powerful, heroic, cinematic mood with bold brass fanfares, sweeping strings, pulsing ostinatos, soaring brass stabs, timpani, taiko, bass drums, low drones, wide stereo, cavernous reverb. Starts with ominous drones, builds rhythmic tension, culminates in bold percussive climax, fades smoothly.",
  "notes_en": "Clear three-part structure (intro, build, climax), but the intro is too long and static while the climax is short and ends abruptly. Harmony limited to two chords, with only repeated string ostinatos and a small ascending figure at the end. Rhythm steady and effective, though tempo measures closer to ~93 BPM than the requested 100. Orchestration cohesive with high-quality sound; strings, percussion, and drones blend well, but brass elements are missing. The narrative arc follows the intended structure but feels underdeveloped due to the brief climax and abrupt ending. Audio is clean and technically polished, with a well-balanced mix, wide stereo, and cavernous reverb as requested."
