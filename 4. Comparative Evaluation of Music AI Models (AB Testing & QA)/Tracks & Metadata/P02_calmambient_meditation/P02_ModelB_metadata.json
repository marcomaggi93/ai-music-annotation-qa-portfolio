  "brief": "~60 seconds of a calm ambient soundtrack for a guided breathing meditation app. Gentle piano chords and sustained strings, evolving slowly with soft reverb and airy pads. No vocals, tempo around 60–70 BPM. Mood: serene, grounding, reflective.",
  "prompt_text": "Calm ambient meditation track at ~65 BPM, instrumental only. Gentle felt piano intro with natural reverb, joined gradually by warm sustained strings and airy pads. Serene, grounding, reflective mood, no percussion, no climax, wide stereo and long reverb tail.",
  "notes_en": "Clear three-part structure with good cohesion; ending is abrupt and could fade more smoothly. Harmony based on four repeated chords, functional for meditation; melody repeats with a final variation, effective but not highly original. Stable rhythm and pulse, though tempo is closer to ~50 BPM instead of 65. Good sound quality: felt piano with natural reverb, strings and airy pads fit well; an added guitar, while stylistically fitting, was not requested. Atmosphere calm and reflective as intended, but the slight crescendo of strings/pads and the guitar add excess motion. Clean audio and balanced mix, though piano is too dominant in the intro. Flow is smooth overall, but the abrupt ending reduces seamlessness and loopability."
