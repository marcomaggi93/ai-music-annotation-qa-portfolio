  "prompt_text": "A heartfelt pop ballad at 72 BPM with expressive female vocals, intimate yet powerful. Nostalgic, longing, and soul-stirring, inspired by Christina Aguilera’s ‘Hurt’. Piano chords lead the arrangement, joined by warm strings, acoustic guitar, lush synth pads, and soft backing harmonies. Gentle electronic percussion and subtle bass support the voice without overpowering it. The song evolves from a tender verse to a soaring chorus, reaching an emotional climax in the bridge before fading into a reflective, cinematic outro."
