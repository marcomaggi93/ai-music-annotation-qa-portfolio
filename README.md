**Human-in-the-Loop AI Music Creation, Annotation & QA Pipeline**

**Project timeline:** May 2025 – December 2025
**Certification:** PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer (May2025)

A structured, end-to-end project focused on AI and music, combining prompt engineering, semi-automatic data annotation, manual annotation, structural segmentation, metadata curation, and quality assurance.
The workflow integrates Python-based automation with expert musical judgment, covering creation, analysis, evaluation, and dataset preparation for music AI systems.
Designed to reflect real-world tasks in Music AI Training, Prompt Engineering, and Music Data QA.
This project uses derived metadata and annotations based on a small subset of the MAESTRO dataset and on AI-generated music tracks.
Original MAESTRO audio and MIDI files are not included and must be obtained from the official source.
This repository is for research and portfolio purposes only.
It contains no original audio or MIDI files.
