Analyzed boundary: 40.4053 sec
Error: False boundary — placed randomly in the middle of the section, without indicating any change in theme, rhythm, harmony, instrumentation, or energy. It does not align with a strong beat, any subdivision, nor is it close to any of my manual boundaries.
Correction: The boundary must be removed entirely.
Expected label: false_boundary
Reason: The model generated a boundary with no musical or structural function: no transition, no harmonic cue, no pre-event signal, and no textural variation.
