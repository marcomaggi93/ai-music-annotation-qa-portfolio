P01,7,4,50%,5,2,0.34,0.76,Heavy over-segmentation in the mid sections with multiple false and silence-based boundaries and two missed core transitions. Intro and mid-theme boundary at 48s are correctly detected, but the high false positive rate lowers overall automatic confidence.
P02,5,3,66.7%,3,1,0.37,0.83,Reasonable structural detection with correct intro boundary and one boundary_shift capturing the main transition. One core section boundary missed near the motivic variation. Overall moderate alignment with noticeable false positive noise.
P03,22,10,30%,18,7,0.20,0.80,Heavy over-segmentation with a very high number of false boundaries. Only a small portion of core structural transitions detected within tolerance. Overall low automatic confidence reflects noisy boundary behavior.
Prompt 3 v2,22,5,40%,20,3, 0.10,0.68,Extreme over-segmentation with dense false boundaries and multiple core transitions completely missed. Only intro and final theme boundaries are detected correctly. Automatic confidence very low due to noisy boundary behavior.
Prompt 3 v3,27,5,60%,24,2,0.15,0.65,Improved alignment compared to v2, with two section transitions correctly captured and one accurately shifted. Still affected by heavy over-segmentation and residual false boundaries, but overall structural detection shows clear progress.
T01_ambient,6,4,25%,5,3,0.37, 0.79,Heavy over-segmentation with numerous false and silence-based boundaries. Multiple core structural transitions are missed despite frequent automatic splits. Only the initial intro boundary is correctly detected.Systematic over-segmentation observed at near-regular ~10s intervals, indicating a time-windowed heuristic rather than content-aware structural detection. This bias causes repeated false boundaries in stable ambient sections and suppresses detection of long-form transitions.
T02_bright_momentum,10,4,50%,8,2,0.23,0.76,Pronounced over-segmentation with numerous false and silence-based boundaries. Two core structural transitions are missed, while the intro and later main section entry are detected (one via boundary shift). Overall automatic confidence remains low due to noisy boundary behavior.
T03_chill_pulse,6,4,50%,3,2,0.37,0.69,Partial alignment with correct detection of intro and an early shift capturing the build entrance. Main section boundary is missed due to a severe early shift, and the final transition is not detected. Presence of false boundaries adds moderate noise.
