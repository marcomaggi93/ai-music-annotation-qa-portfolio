P01,28.6%,50%,High false positive rate with multiple spurious automatic boundaries across stable sections. Two core structural transitions were completely missed, resulting in moderate recall (50%) and low precision (28.6%). Only intro and one central transition were correctly detected. Manual annotations show high confidence and structural clarity.
P02,40%,66.7%,Moderate recall with successful detection of intro and main section transition, including one correctly shifted boundary. However, a high number of false positives inside stable sections significantly reduces precision. The final structural transition was completely missed, indicating under-segmentation toward the end of the track. Manual annotations remain consistent and confident.
P03,13.6%,30%,Severe over-segmentation with a very high number of spurious automatic boundaries across stable vocal and harmonic passages. Only three structural transitions were correctly detected, resulting in very low precision (13.6%) and low recall (30%). Multiple musically salient transitions (pre-chorus, chorus entries, bridge, and ending sections) were entirely missed, indicating poor alignment with formal pop-song structure despite correct detection of intro and one mid-song transition.
Prompt 3 v2,9.1%,40%,Extremely high over-segmentation with dense automatic boundary output across nearly the entire track. Only the intro and final section onset were correctly identified. Core structural transitions (theme entry, build, and variation) were entirely missed, resulting in very low precision (9.1%) despite moderate recall (40%). The model shows strong sensitivity to local novelty and silence artifacts rather than large-scale structural changes.
Prompt 3 v3,11.1%,60%,Very high over-segmentation with a dense distribution of false automatic boundaries across sustained textures. Despite low precision (11.1%), recall is higher (60%) compared to earlier versions, indicating improved detection of true large-scale structural transitions, including interlude and final reprise onsets. However, core thematic entries were still missed, and silence-based splits contributed to false positives.
T01_ambient,16.7%,25%,Severe under-detection of core structural transitions combined with multiple false positive splits across stable passages. Only the intro onset was correctly identified, resulting in very low recall (25%) and low precision (16.7%). The automatic system failed to detect all main thematic and build-related section changes, while producing spurious boundaries including silence-based splits. Manual annotations show high confidence and clear macro-structural organization.
T02_bright_momentum,20%,50%,Heavy over-segmentation across the entire track with multiple spurious boundaries clustered in stable passages. Only the intro and final thematic re-entry were successfully detected, yielding low precision (20%) and moderate recall (50%). Core mid-structure transitions were missed, while silence-based and false boundaries significantly contributed to false positives. Manual annotations show clear and confident macro-structural definition.
T03_chill_pulse,33%,50%,Moderate detection of early structural transitions, with correct identification of intro and initial build entry. However, later macro sections were not reliably detected, leading to missed core transitions and several false positives. Precision remains limited (33%) due to over-detection, while recall (50%) indicates partial sensitivity to genuine section onsets. Manual annotations show stable and confident macro-structural organization.
