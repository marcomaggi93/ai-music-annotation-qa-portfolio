Manual Structural Segmentation Guideline

(Listening-Based QA Workflow)

1. What Really Matters (What to Label)

Only mark structural changes, meaning the formal sections of the track — parts that clearly fulfill a different musical function.

Typical structural sections include:

Intro

Verse / Section A (main theme)

Verse Variation / A1

Pre-Chorus

Chorus

Bridge / Middle Section

Build-up / Climax

Final Chorus

Outro

Example — Typical Pop / Pop Ballad Structure

A common pop or pop ballad form:

Intro

Verse 1

Pre-Chorus

Chorus

Verse 2

Pre-Chorus

Chorus

Bridge

Final Chorus

Outro

Or a more compact variant:

Intro

Verse

Chorus

Verse

Chorus

Bridge

Final Chorus

Outro

The goal is not to force theoretical labels, but to identify when the musical role of the track clearly changes and stabilizes into a new section.

2. What You Should NOT Label

Do not label:

every pad or layer entrance

individual drum hits or accent changes

small harmonic embellishments

short crescendos or diminuendos

minor texture fluctuations

These elements are diagnostic cues, not sections themselves.
They help you identify boundaries, but they are not boundaries on their own.

3. Correct Level of Detail (QA + Portfolio-Ready)

Aim for a balanced level of granularity:

not too shallow

not overly fragmented

Target guideline:

2–5 sections for a 1:30–2:00 track

3–4 sections is the most common and stable outcome

Example

Intro (0–10s)

Section A (10–35s)

Section B (35–60s)

Build-up (60–75s)

Outro (75–90s)

This level of detail matches industry QA expectations and is ideal for portfolio presentation.

4. Listening-Based Segmentation (Primary Method)

Listening is the most important step.

While listening, note moments where you clearly perceive:

Harmonic change
→ new chord progression, modulation, or tonal shift

Instrumental entry or exit
→ drums, bass, pads, strings, vocals entering or dropping

Theme or melodic change / variation
→ new motif, new phrase, or clear variation of material

Energy or dynamic shift
→ sustained increase or decrease in intensity

Tempo, groove, or rhythmic character change,
if stable and maintained over time
→ possible new section

When one or more of these changes occur and persist, you are likely at a real structural boundary.

5. Audacity as Visual & Technical Support
A) Waveform Inspection

Zoom into the waveform and look for:

dense blocks (higher energy)

thinner blocks (lower energy)

silence gaps or near-silence

visible pattern changes

These often correlate with section transitions.

B) Adding Labels

Press Ctrl + B at the chosen boundary

Use provisional names:

Boundary_1

New_Section

Section_Start

C) Refining Boundaries

Drag labels to refine timing

Always prioritize what you hear, not just what you see
