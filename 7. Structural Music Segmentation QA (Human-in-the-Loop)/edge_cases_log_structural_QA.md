# Edge Cases Log – Week 07 (Manual Segmentation)

## 1. Edge Case 1 – Ambiguous Sections (Variation vs. Distinct Sections)

• What I was listening to:
Prompt 3 v2 — an expressive cinematic cue for a natural-documentary scene.
After the initial Intro of deep cello drones, the cue enters a very long main block where the cello carries the entire melodic line, supported only by low drones acting as a sustained bass foundation.

• Why it was ambiguous:
Structurally, this central section lasts about 2 minutes and 30 seconds within a 3:44 cue.
Throughout this entire span:

the cello remains the sole melodic driver

the low drones provide continuous harmonic support

there are no clear harmonic changes, no new themes, and no changes in orchestration

Everything is built from the same core materials, so it was unclear whether this should be treated as one very long section or subdivided based on internal expressive shifts.

• How I resolved it:
I chose to divide this long main block into three macro-subsections, each marked by a distinct functional or expressive change:

First subsection (after the Intro):
Introduction of the main cello theme with low drones.
Expressive but not yet at peak intensity.

Second subsection:
Piano accompaniment enters, and the cello line becomes more varied, intense, and dynamically active.
This textural change clearly marks a new internal phase.

Third subsection:
The cello shifts to longer, higher-register notes, reducing expressive intensity and creating a moment of release before the final reprise.
This change in phrasing and contour functions as a contrasting subsection.

• Resolution criteria (theme / intensity / instrumentation):
I based the segmentation on:

Thematic function:
Main theme → intensified variation → elongated high-register phrasing.

Expressive intensity (emotional contour):
The emotional shape shifts clearly in three stages despite the stable harmony.

Instrumentation:
The piano entry provides the strongest marker of an internal transition within the homogeneous main block.

This justified segmenting the long central section into three coherent subsections, without treating them as fully independent sections.

## 2. Edge Case 2 – Hybrid Transitions (Anticipations, Overlaps, Non-Clean Boundaries)

• Why this was a hybrid case:
In P03 – Pop Ballad, several transitions were not cleanly separated.
The vocal line often anticipates the entry of new sections, starting the first words before the downbeat (e.g., leading into the Choruses).
At another point, at the start of the Bridge, the last syllable of the Chorus continues exactly on the downbeat where the new harmony begins, creating an overlap between the end of one section and the beginning of the next.

These situations create ambiguity because:

the melodic material of the new section begins early (anticipation),

but the phrasing of the previous section sometimes extends over the structural downbeat,

and the accompaniment does not stop cleanly between sections.

• What I decided:

✔ Case 1 — Vocal anticipation before the Chorus

When the singer delivers the first word(s) before the downbeat, I marked the beginning of the new section on the vocal entrance, even if it is off-beat.
The anticipatory vocal line belongs to the new section because it introduces the new lyrical and melodic function.

✔ Case 2 — Final syllable from the Chorus landing on the Bridge downbeat

When the last syllable of the Chorus falls exactly on the downbeat of the Bridge — while the new chord progression starts — I aligned the section boundary with the downbeat of the new harmony, not with the tail of the voice.
The lingering syllable acts as a releasing tail from the previous section, not as material of the new one.

• Resolution rule applied:
 A new section begins with the new musical function: theme, harmony, or structural onset — not with tails or pickups from the previous section.

In practice:

Melodic anticipations that introduce new thematic or lyrical material belong to the new section.

Tails and final syllables that simply complete the previous phrase belong to the previous section, even if they land on the downbeat.

The structural downbeat with a new harmony/groove defines the start of the Bridge or any major formal section.

## 3. Edge Case 3 – Non-Distinct Harmonic Changes (Stable Progression / Minor Variations)

• Why it was not a real section change:
In Prompt 3 v2 (an expressive cinematic cue for a natural-documentary scene), there is a long passage of approximately 1 minute and 7 seconds built entirely on the same four-chord progression, repeated three full times.
Throughout this whole span:

the instrumentation remains identical (cello melody + low drones + piano)

the harmonic function never changes

the texture stays the same

the expressive intensity remains exactly the same, with no build, no drop, and no change in emotional contour

The only evolving element is the melodic variation of the cello.
This alone is not sufficient to justify a new section, because it does not alter the function, the harmony, or the energy level of the cue.

• Criteria used (theme / function / intensity):

Thematic function:
The cello introduces small melodic variations, but they are all part of the same thematic development, not independent themes.

Harmonic function:
The four-chord cycle repeats without modulation or functional contrast.

Texture / Instrumentation:
The accompaniment (low drones) remains unchanged for the whole duration.

Expressive intensity:
The intensity is completely stable — no crescendo, no diminuendo, no structural shift.

• How I documented the final decision:
I labeled this entire 1:07 passage as one unified macro-section, noting that the internal differences are intra-sectional variations, not structural boundaries.
In the manual segmentation file, this appears as a single region label, with a comment explaining that the stable harmony, texture, and intensity justify keeping it as a single section.

## 4. Edge Case 4 – FALSE TRANSITION (Intro vs. Build as a Separate Section)

• What I was listening to

While listening to T03 "Chill Pulse Motion"(EDM), the section after the Intro (Vocal Textures — Light Mix) presented:

- the same melodic phrase of the female vocalises

- the same harmonic pattern, with only one variation on the last chord

- the same basic texture (soft synth layer, vocal textures, bass synth)

- similar duration (around 10 seconds)

But also:

- strengthened bass synth

- added new percussive elements

- progressive energy increase anticipating the full groove

- clearly preparatory function (“rising energy”)

It was therefore difficult to understand whether it was a distinct section (Build)
or simply an extension of the Intro with added instruments.

• Why it was ambiguous

Main ambiguity:

- Identical melody as the Intro → no new thematic material

- Almost identical harmony, except the final chord → doesn’t indicate a real change

- Very similar texture, only the density changes

- No break or formal structural element typical of transitions

- The new section feels like a more energetic version of the Intro

• How I resolved it

I decided to separate Intro and Build into two distinct sections because of:

- Clear increase in energy

- Introduction of new percussive elements

- Stronger bass synth

- The final chord of the Build differs from the last chord of the Intro; the bass plays a different note

- The function of the second part is clearly preparatory to the drop

Therefore, even though they share melodic/harmonic material, the second part serves a different musical function.

• Resolution criteria

To distinguish Intro vs. Build, I used:

✔ Musical function

Intro = setup, low lighting, zero momentum

Build = preparation, energy increase, push toward the drop/groove

✔ Energy / Density

Intro = low

Build = medium with “rising energy”

✔ Instrumentation

Intro = vocal textures, snaps, light bass

Build = strengthened bass, added percussion, slightly increased harmonic tension

✔ Transition toward a key event
The Build prepares the Main Section (Full Groove). This is the decisive proof that it's a distinct section.
